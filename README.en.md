### Method 2: Configure timing operation

------

````
EDITOR=vim crontab -e
````

**Enter a scheduled task**
Do it every five hours (because you're unlikely to have the machine on)
 ````0 */5 * * * /bin/sh ~/cron.sh```

**View scheduled tasks**
````
crontab -l
````



### Program configuration file example

Note the spaces
````
RenewConfig: True
RenewTargetKey: cloud22
content:
   cloud1:
       - https://
   cloud22:
       - https://

````

```RenewConfig``` refers to whether to replace the running dependent config, ```RenewTargetKey``` refers to the replacement target (must be in the list)




Edit the python script and configure the config file name and data directory as noted.
